Ray Tracing
===============

This repository serves as a hub for all ray tracing implementations i make. Currently only a java project exists, but a c# implementation will be added later. 

The "Runnable Builds" folder includes the latest working builds.

Current problems - Java:
 - Reflections does not work
 - Rays only work with a start position of 0,0,0
